# CJD-Lunch
This project is about developing a website for School which allows students to vote for their favourite dish. I have also added a Foodbytes page (information about your diet) 
FAQ page, Forum page as well as a Feedback page.
This project is my first ever website using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and PHP.
Improvements will be made in the future...
